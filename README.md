# i18n Nexus

English | [‰∏≠Êñá](./README_zh.md)

**i18n Nexus** is your ultimate localization companion for `next-intl` projects. Streamline your internationalization workflow with AI-powered translations, smart incremental updates, and collaborative feedback tools.

## Why Choose i18n Nexus?

When developing multilingual applications, we often face the following challenges:

1. **Time-consuming translation process**: Traditional methods require frequent translation of entire files, even when only a small portion of the content has changed.
2. **Difficulty in file synchronization**: When content is added or deleted in the base language file, ensuring all target language files are synchronized is a tedious task.
3. **Complex management of large JSON files**: As projects grow, manually managing and updating large language JSON files becomes extremely difficult and prone to errors.

## Key Features

- üöÄ **AI-Powered Translations**: Leverage cutting-edge LLM technology for accurate and context-aware translations.
- üîÑ **Incremental Updates**: Efficiently translate only what's changed, saving time and preserving existing translations.
- üåê **Multi-Language Support**: Easily manage translations for multiple target languages from a single source.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Customizable Workflow**: Configure your base language, target languages, and preferred LLM provider.
- üìù **Feedback Mechanism**: Collaboratively improve translations with a built-in feedback system.

## Quick Start

1. **Install**: Search for "i18n Nexus" in the VSCode extension store and install.
2. **Configure**: Set your base path, languages, and LLM provider in VSCode settings (search for "i18n Nexus").
3. **Translate**: Use the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) and run `i18n Nexus: Translate Files`.
4. **Review**: Check generated translations in your message files.
5. **Feedback**: Use `i18n Nexus: Provide Translation Feedback` to suggest improvements.

## Configuration Options

You can configure i18n Nexus directly in your VSCode settings:

- `i18nNexus.basePath`: Relative path to the messages folder.
- `i18nNexus.baseLanguage`: Base language code (e.g., 'en' for English).
- `i18nNexus.targetLanguages`: Array of target language codes.
- `i18nNexus.llmProvider`: Selected LLM provider (e.g., `openai`, `gemini`, etc.).
- `i18nNexus.llmApiUrl`: API URL for the selected LLM provider.
- `i18nNexus.llmApiKey`: API Key for the selected LLM provider.

## How It Works

i18n Nexus uses advanced AI models to understand and translate your text. It analyzes your base language file, identifies new or changed content, and then only translates these parts. This incremental update method is both efficient and maintains translation consistency.

## Notes

- Ensure to keep your API key secure.
- For first-time use, it's recommended to test on non-critical projects.
- AI translations may not be perfect, human review is recommended.
